# gridGab

## About
This is gridGab, a basic chat app using MERN and Socket.IO. Has account creation and management, live messaging, 1-on-1 chats, group chats, chat rooms, admins, some personalization features, and notifications. First version was created in 2 days while learning how socket.io works. 

## Future features
- [] Image uploads
- [] Chat replies / quote-chat messages
- [] A personal section for notes. In discord, this is often achieved by creating a personal server only for yourself for putting notes and links. It works, but it gets cluttered quickly. Would like to make this a bit more integrated and useful. 
- [] Discord-style servers, server channels, and channel threads. 
- [] Copying message IDs and being able to link to them, if you have access to a given chat room.
